# Gradient-Descent
In this tutorial, we are covering few important concepts in machine learning such as cost function, gradient descent, learning rate and mean squared error. We will use home price prediction use case to understand gradient descent. After going over math behind these concepts, we will write python code to implement gradient descent for linear regression in python.
